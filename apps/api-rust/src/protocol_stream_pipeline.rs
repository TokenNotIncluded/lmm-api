//! Pre-wired, closed-by-default typed streaming pipeline.
//!
//! The pipeline consumes complete [`SseFrame`] values from the existing
//! incremental parser.  It deliberately does not own a router, an HTTP body,
//! or a provider decoder.  Same-protocol traffic is an opaque raw passthrough
//! and borrows the parser's bytes.  Cross-protocol traffic is admitted only
//! after the route gate and an explicitly supplied source-to-canonical-
//! to-target adaptor are both present.  The default adaptor registry is empty,
//! so the current validated registry remains closed for every cross-protocol
//! stream.
