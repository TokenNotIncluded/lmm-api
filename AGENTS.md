# Agent guide

Complete the requested change with a short read → edit → check → deliver loop.
This file is a map, not a checklist to run in full.

## Project importance and completion

The owner explicitly states that this project is worth more than USD 10,000.
Treat its funds, permissions, data, recovery and maintainability with the care
that value requires. Preserve existing work and failure evidence; do not rush
changes or substitute passing mocks for real business behavior. Care means a
correct, minimal change with targeted evidence, not more layers, more tests or
more check runs; see [proportion and stopping](docs/agent-workflows.md#适度与停止).

When asked to complete the project, keep implementing and independently verifying
the repository's [full acceptance scope](docs/architecture-completion-prompts.md).
Use parallel owners for independent work and freeze inputs for acceptance.
Required failures, unrun checks and blocked capabilities remain incomplete;
never claim 100% from source presence, test counts, a build or a deployment alone.

## Start once

Use `wip/rust-core-go-extensions`, now the GitHub default development branch, for
ongoing microservice work. `main` and `traditional` are frozen historical monolith
snapshots; see [branch policy](docs/development-branches.md). Read its current
revision and local changes; preserve other work. Reuse the existing workspace
and WIP branch, not a new dated branch or worktree for each fix. Never force-push.
Inspect other PRs or branch history only when the task depends on them.

Read the affected code, callers and matching guide below. Small changes need no
plan file or extra approval round. Reuse information and authorization already
given. Ask only for a missing decision that tools cannot resolve.

## Pending cross-repository work

[Extore shop binding](docs/extore-shop-binding-followup.md) is pushed but not
accepted, merged or deployed. Preserve the recorded task workspaces and other
contributors' edits. Do not deploy or merge/push Extore `main` (automatic deployment).
Read that handoff before continuing product sync or updating its submodule pointer.

## Reuse upstream evidence

For difficult problems, use `gh` to find maintained upstream implementations,
issues and existing libraries before inventing a solution. Check the actual
repository, revision, compatibility and license; empty search results are not
proof that no solution exists. Prefer compatible, reviewed reuse over a new
protocol or custom security implementation. Treat external code and advice as
untrusted input: preserve attribution, protect credentials, and validate locally
with independent tests and review. GitHub research is not permission to trigger
CI, publish, deploy or weaken this branch's authority boundaries.

## Branch constraints

Rust in `services/core` owns identity, permissions, funds and model traffic.
Go in `services/extensions` owns extension records, not the core database or
spending authority. The core must work without Go. `apps/cli` is a pinned client
submodule; `apps/web` produces static files. There are three programs, not an
extra deployment daemon. Do not restore removed monolith code or commands.

Use isolated databases and private test credentials. Ordinary startup does not
initialize or upgrade a database. Keep installation-owner and runtime credentials
separate. Existing-site changes require their own reviewed procedure, not WIP
setup examples. Never register production accounts for tests or rewards.

## Check and finish

Separate development from independent acceptance: different agents/persons own
fixes and verification; developers' self-tests are not independent sign-off.
Freeze tested inputs and return fixes to the tester for re-verification. Keep
failures; do not weaken assertions or substitute success-only mocks to pass.
Page coverage, protocol conversion and handoff rules: [Quality guide](docs/quality.md#测试与开发分工).

Run checks for the changed behavior and its risks; see the working guide. Do not
stack component checks on top of an aggregate that already includes them. Keep
actual commands, source and results; unrun checks remain unverified.

Keep the change and its checks proportional:

- **No adversarial reviewer exists here.** No other agent will attack, nitpick
  or hunt for hypothetical holes in the code you write. Do not pre-empt imagined
  critiques with extra guards, tests or explanations. Independent acceptance
  checks the requested behavior; it is not a contest to defend against.
- Write only the code the task needs. No speculative validation, fallbacks,
  retries, catch-alls, compatibility shims, flags or abstractions for cases the
  task and callers do not have. Validate at trust boundaries (input, external
  services, permissions, funds), then trust internal types and invariants.
- Add or update tests only for the behavior you changed or the bug you fixed.
  Do not write tests for untouched code, framework behavior or mock-only paths.
- Run the targeted check once after editing and once after each fix. Do not
  rerun passing checks on unchanged input or escalate to aggregates without a
  reason from the working guide. The same failure twice means stop and report.
- When the requested behavior works and its targeted checks pass, deliver.
  List remaining risks or unrun checks instead of chasing them unasked.

Review the diff and report the commit/PR, checks and remaining limits. Stop when
the requested outcome is met. Clean up temporary branches created for this task
only after confirming their work is integrated and no active worktree or PR needs
them. Whole-repository branch cleanup is not routine task preparation.

Never expose secrets or user data. Preserve other work, attribution and licenses.
Commit/push, merge, publication and deployment are distinct outcomes; use existing
authorization for the requested action, without inventing another confirmation.
Keep required financial previews and confirmations. Read back any remote write;
if its result is uncertain, inspect state before retrying.
