# Payment money contract

This is the financial safety boundary for the fresh-install microservice WIP, not
an assertion that payments are enabled. Rust owns identity, authorization, payer
selection, balances and ledger receipts. Go owns provider orders, evidence and
module-local business state; it never chooses credit amounts or accesses the core
database. The Go host supports explicit `payments` assembly and, with
`host.web_compat = true`, a read-only Web payment status route. Payments remain
opt-in; host readiness does not prove provider readiness or full financial
acceptance. See [architecture](core-migration.md) and the
[payment module](../services/extensions/internal/modules/payments/README.md).

## Units and compatibility

A bare number or `$` symbol is not a money type. Every boundary must identify its
unit, currency, scale and protocol version.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Legacy Web `CREDIT` | Integer raw wallet credits, historically 500000 credits per USD. Not model tokens or legacy batches. |
| Current core `credit_500k_usd` | The unit currently declared by Rust billing, the ledger schema and Protobuf: 500000 integer units per USD. |
| Provider `amount_minor` | Integer smallest units of the explicitly named ISO fiat currency; not wallet credits. |
| Fiat FX and price multipliers | Separate conversion/pricing policy, never a new ledger denomination. |

The browser declaration does not authorize a core monetary operation. Its unit
must match the explicit core type and versioned protocol. Any boundary with a
different unit requires a validated, exact adapter; never pass an unchanged integer
between scales or infer a conversion from an untyped field.

Amounts and arithmetic must remain exact integers or decimals, with checked
bounds and overflow. Do not pass 64-bit values beyond JavaScript's exact integer
range through `Number`. Display currency, language, FX, model tokens, coupons and
recharge prices never alter the ledger unit. USD and CNY totals are kept separate.

This branch installs empty databases; it does not run the retired Go balance or
subscription migrations. Historical corrections require separately authorized
scope, snapshots, reviewed integer rounding, writer quiescence, durable duplicate
protection and cache invalidation. Do not relabel balances, alter the denomination
or rewrite paid orders, prices or usage history to simulate a correction. Missing
or inconsistent calibration blocks financial operations. Historical procedures
remain in the [archive](archive.md).

## Legacy Web input boundary

The retained Web wallet sends `{amount:q,amount_unit:"CREDIT"}` to
`/api/user/topup/currency/v2/` quote, checkout and discount-validation routes.
These are legacy frontend compatibility calls, not enabled native core payment
routes. A missing route or capability must disable checkout rather than fall back
to an endpoint that might interpret `q` as legacy batches or another scale.

`X-LMM-Credit-Unit: 500000` declares that browser input contract; it is not an
identity or authorization credential. It never rescales request bodies. An input
unit mismatch or an uncertain mutation must not trigger automatic replay.

The selected amount, payment method, discount code and input revision bind the
quote and confirmation. Changing any of them invalidates the old confirmation.
Use current authoritative limits and a matching quote; unavailable or failed
validation is not permission to pay. The server independently recalculates and
enforces every amount, provider and promotion limit. A top-up navigation link
only prefills a form; it does not place an order or grant value.

## Payment evidence, receipts and refunds

Before provider checkout, persist the economic account and actor, exact credited
amount and unit, expected settlement amount and ISO currency, provider, merchant,
environment, product/store binding, stable order key and applied pricing policy.
Callbacks can grant value only after independent verification against that frozen
intent. Go cannot assert verification with a boolean, service token or supplied
user ID. A callback acknowledgement or locally queued job is not a posted credit.

Confirm browser payment by the exact order ID in the authenticated owner's order
history. A larger balance, similar amount, newer history ID or checkout URL
parameter is not payment evidence. Credentials, provider signatures and bearer
links never belong in public status, logs or presentation receipts.

An exact retry retains its authenticated scope, original key and complete payload;
a changed request under that key is rejected. Missing responses and timeouts may
mean the commit succeeded. Query/reconcile that operation before any new attempt;
do not invent a fresh debit, refund, release or compensating transfer. Validate
receipt identity, unit, committed state and original-operation binding. A pending
result is a recovery handle, not usable value.

Refunds use the captured charge, fiat conversion and entitlement snapshot, and
return value only to the original economic payer. Enforce the cumulative original
amount cap. Hold funds before a provider refund; independently verified terminal
success commits the bound refund. A terminal failure can release a hold only when
Core can bind it to the original dispatch and rule out another successful send.
The current refund-release path remains unavailable and retains the hold. Timeout,
missing callback or unsigned success proves neither. A pre-credit refund must fence later
stale credit replay. Ledger refund and external provider payout are separate steps.

Native top-up refunds use `refund_topup` against the original credit journal.
The ledger takes available wallet units first, then restores debt for any
remaining refunded credit, including credit that previously repaid debt. The
refund reference is `provider:channel_id:refund_id`; changing an event or request
key cannot post that reference twice. An exact key and payload replay returns
the original receipt. A duplicate reference is a conflict, not a new unresolved
refund fact. Refund counters, ledger changes, hold release and receipts commit
together. After a failed response, query/reconcile the original operation; do not
assume rollback or create a replacement request key.

This bridge requires the original native credit. It does not enable historical
refund dispatch or turn an opening balance into a replayed top-up. The legacy
rounding helper only computes an integer delta; historical basis import and its
reviewed ledger binding remain separate work.

## Account-authorized payment status reads

With `payments` and Web compatibility explicitly assembled, `GET` and `HEAD`
`/api/user/payments/orders/{top_id}` use the host's admission and drain lifecycle.
The Web reader forwards the original authenticated user bearer to `Service.Get`;
Rust rechecks current access to the order's payment intent and economic account.
The host token, order creator or a caller-supplied user/account ID cannot replace
that authorization. A mounted Web route without the reader authenticates first,
then returns `503 PAYMENT_DISABLED`. Other methods are forbidden; this route
cannot create an order, post a credit or request a refund.

The status handler sends `Cache-Control: no-store`. Its data contains only
`order_id`, `state`, `currency`, `amount_minor`, `provider_paid`,
`core_credit_confirmed` and optional `refund_dispatch`. It exposes no checkout
URL, provider identifiers, signatures, jobs, receipts or credentials.
`amount_minor` is fiat in the named currency, not wallet credits.

A rejected credit or unresolved stopped work awaiting `review` is shown as
`review`, rather than promising indefinite progress. A historical review job
must not hide later authoritative credit or refund completion. If any refund
dispatch is `unknown`, that value takes precedence over `responded` from another
refund. A missing `refund_dispatch`, including a historical row without dispatch
evidence, proves neither that no provider write occurred nor that a retry is
safe. Current workers record `unknown` when claiming a refund send, persist
`responded` after a provider response, and retain `unknown` for uncertain results.
These fields are read-only observations, not new financial authority.

`provider_paid` alone does not establish a posted core credit.
`core_credit_confirmed` records only the original completed credit; refunds or
spending may have removed that value, so it is not the current balance, spendable
funds or a new spending authorization.

This read path does not enable checkout, provider callbacks or refund writes,
and is not evidence of production payment or deployment acceptance. Independent
joint coverage and its remaining limits are recorded in the
[payment acceptance guide](../tests/payments/README.md).

## Funding, transfers and subscription lifecycle

Store actor, Key owner and payer separately. A personal Key defaults to its own
account; a team Key uses only its team. Current membership and explicit spending
grants are required. Platform roles, host credentials and tool installation do
not grant authority to spend someone else's funds.

Fix the payer, price version, budget window and funding components when accepting
a request. Retries, streaming completion, callbacks and refunds retain them even
after membership or Key changes. Select only explicitly authorized sources; an
unknown result, permission failure or database error cannot fall back to another
payer. One request does not split payment across unrelated accounts.

Authorization, applicable budgets, pending reservations, ledger movements and
audit/outbox records need a consistent transaction boundary. Leave/rejoin, role
changes and new Keys cannot reset accumulated budget. Do not hold database
transactions over provider calls or streams. A dependency outage must fail closed,
never allow an uncharged request or manufacture a zero balance.

Transfer debit, claim/cancel transition, credit/refund and receipt commit together;
repeat requests cannot move funds twice. Links and QR codes are bearer credentials:
keep secrets in URL fragments and request bodies, never public query strings or
third-party QR services. Ordinary GET must not claim. Tool writes require the exact
active grant and explicit confirmation bound to actor, auth version, tool/version,
request and amount, rechecked on dispatch/resume. Resume the original uncertain
request. Retain financial history and tombstones; do not delete or refund records
outside the state machine.

Subscription orders freeze plan, currency, entitlement and provider bindings.
Renewals have unique event/transaction keys and recorded periods; failed or
`past_due` payments grant no new period. Cancel-at-period-end preserves paid access.
Immediate cancellation/refund follows verified evidence and policy. Do not reprice
existing orders from today's plan, FX or settings. Round only at the defined
provider boundary and persist the exact rounded amount to verify later.

## Pricing, rewards and safety review

Price reads and unchanged saves preserve stored bytes, expressions and captured
calibration. Missing historical calibration is unknown, not permission to use
current values. Monetary edits require an explicit unit/version, selective keys
and a revision check; stale revisions need a fresh read, not a blind overwrite or
USD fallback to a legacy endpoint. Every writer respects exact model-price locks.
Validate complete committed snapshots and requested lock state; malformed replies
or transport errors do not prove rollback or authorize a stale fallback.

Rewards need independently verified eligibility, a funded authorized treasury,
durable entitlement uniqueness, bounded policy and a matching ledger receipt.
Gifts, transfers and manual order completion are not proof of cash payment. Keep
promised policy snapshots, append-only grants/reversals and first-payment markers;
callbacks, refunds or appeals cannot silently reset eligibility. The promotions
module's unavailable Rust reward adapter must remain closed until that authority
exists; fake top-ups and generic transfers are not substitutes.

Risk scores and model confidence are review heuristics, not proof of abuse or
authority to ban, change roles or move funds. Shared networks or ordinary language
alone do not authorize sanctions. Recheck actor ownership, durable evidence and
permissions for sensitive actions; keep protected-role boundaries and audit.
Expose only owner-scoped, minimized/redacted data, never foreign private messages,
identities or credentials. Review resets do not delete historical receipts.

Content moderation defaults off and requires explicit published scope and policy.
Failed, pending, partial or unreviewed content and model output cannot become a
user violation or penalty. At most one explicitly configured, capped penalty may
apply per original request; never create negative debt or collect a shortfall from
future top-ups. Preserve deduplication, exact actual-charge receipts, human appeal,
privacy and applicable notice requirements. These constraints do not enable the
retired moderation or referral APIs in the current host.
