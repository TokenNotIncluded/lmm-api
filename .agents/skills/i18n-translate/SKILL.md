# Frontend translations

Read the changed call site and existing English copy. Locale files are
`apps/web/src/i18n/locales/*.json`, under `translation`; the helper discovers the
actual languages. Keep brand names, identifiers and `{{variables}}` intact.
Use [the glossary](../../../docs/translation-glossary.md) when terminology needs
clarification. Never copy task instructions into translation values.

Create a temporary JSON patch outside the repository, with every supported
locale and the same changed keys in each. Values must be real, non-empty
translations. Use [the existing helper](scripts/apply-translations.mjs):

```bash
mise exec -- node .agents/skills/i18n-translate/scripts/apply-translations.mjs /tmp/lmm-translations.json
mise exec -- bun run --filter @lmm/web i18n:sync
```

Use the actual patch path. Apply validates locales and placeholders before
writing; a separate `--check` is for a requested preview, not required before
applying the same patch. Do not copy a writer or manually edit locale JSON.
Writes are sequential, not atomic across files; inspect a partial failure first.

Review every changed locale and generated `_reports/_sync-report.json` and
`_extras` output. Preserve unrelated changes. Sync is a write operation, not a
translation service: it chooses the locale with the most leaf keys as its base,
fills missing values and moves extras. Zero missing keys does not prove correct
translation. Read [the implementation](../../../apps/web/scripts/sync-i18n.mjs)
only when needed; do not hand-edit reports to conceal errors.

For value-only changes, validate the patch and final locale diff. Call-site or
type changes also need affected tests and `mise exec -- bun run typecheck:web`.
Check affected long-text/mobile layouts when text changes layout. No full Web
build is needed solely for JSON text. Report missing language/browser checks.
Only helper-code changes require its `node --test` self-test suite.

Done means complete changed keys across actual locales, preserved variables,
reviewed sync output and reported checks. Delete only your own temporary patch.

No adversarial reviewer will nitpick these strings; follow [proportion and stopping](../../../docs/agent-workflows.md#适度与停止).
Apply the patch once, review the diff and stop. Do not add extra validation
scripts, retranslate unchanged keys or rerun sync on unchanged input.
